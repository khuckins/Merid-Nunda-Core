# Merid-Nunda Core
> The Colored Rooms are a rotating Wheel, a mournful imitation of Nirn, which Meridia so longs to be a true part of. Her wheel has no temperance, though; it is impatient and whirls this way and that, changing faster than a mortal can compregened, if indeed it has ever changed at all.

 Merid-Nunda Core is the library behind Adventurer's Guide to Tamriel. It contains scripts, spells, statuses, passives, and various other supplemental material that Adventurer's Guide to Tamriel may draw on. Used by itself, you will see no changes - however, it is a requirement for any mod that draws on its content. Consider it a modder's resource.

#### Why Merid-Nunda?
Lore-wise, Merid-Nunda is the original name for Meridia, a Daedric Prince who was originally an et'Ada, a being that fled to Aetherius when the mortal realm was created. The et'Ada's flight broke holes into the universe, through which Magicka was able to flow. As this library introduces Abilities and Scripts, the name felt fitting.

## Installation
This mod works with BG3 Mod Manager. Vortex and manual installation may also work, however I can only support BG3 Mod Manager at this time.
